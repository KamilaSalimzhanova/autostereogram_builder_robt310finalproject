# autostereogram_builder_robt310finalproject
A five-band autostereogram using texture shift algorithm. 
# Intsructions for the usage:
Hold the autostereogram right to the nose and pull it very slowly away from the face. The viewer must look through the picture and try not to blink his/her eyes. When a computer screen is used for viewing an autostereogram, we suggest displaying it inside a bigger black window.
